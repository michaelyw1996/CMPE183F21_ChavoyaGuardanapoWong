## Project Introduction
Task it!™ is a web application that allows users to create tasks, as well as check off tasks whenever a certain task is completed. Whenever a new task is created the task will be listed/shown on the web page.     

Students and working people are busy in general. They also have a lot going on in their personal lives. They’re sometimes overwhelmed with the amount of work they’re given that they sometimes forget other important tasks. A website like Task it!™ could be utilized like a site to manage and keep track of ones notes. This will help students and busy working people prioritize their tasks/notes.
