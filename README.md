## Project Introduction
Task it!™ is a web application that allows users to create tasks, as well as check off tasks whenever a certain task is completed. Whenever a new task is created the task will be listed/shown on the web page.     

Students and working people are busy in general. They also have a lot going on in their personal lives. They’re sometimes overwhelmed with the amount of work they’re given that they sometimes forget other important tasks. A website like Task it!™ could be utilized like a site to manage and keep track of ones notes. This will help students and busy working people prioritize their tasks/notes.

## Testing
For this project, the type of testing that was done was smart contract testing through the Truffle Console. 
A Javascript test file was created to test the smart contract. Within this test file, the Mocha framework and Chai
assertion library were used. Tests were written in Javascript. To run the test, we utilized the command prompt and entered "$ truffle test".
Once all tests pass, it was safe to deploy contracts without wasting unnecessary Ether.
